This is an internship project, in which I trained a model for detection of diffferent hand gestures in the gamae "Rock Paper Scissors"

Stack: Python(Programming Language), PyTorch(Developing the Model) and MatPlotLib(Graphing Data).

3 models developed (Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Resnet)
